Mainly only local Zürich people go there to enjoy a night out. It is located near clubs and bars so perfect for a dinner before going out. The food is excellent and it seems like fresh ingredients are being used. It is often crowded so make a reservation beforehand and also be patient as the service might get a bit slow at peak hours.\n","Review#: 3 / Rating: 4 / Text: Cool italian place right beside the station. Pizza was flavorful and the thin crust was great. Pistachio gelato was also very good 😋. It took too long to serve the gelato though, one of the waiters probably forgot but otherwise I had great service from them (I arrived before peak dinner time)\n","Review#: 4 / Rating: 5 / Text: Great pizzas, friendly staff. The kitchen was closed on a Wednesday around 22:00 as many restaurants in the area, pizza cook still tossing dough, though.  They seem to become patio nightclubs more than restaurants. A glass was placed at my table, after reading other reviews, it seems water is either self service where the carafes are on the wall, or they want you to order bottled. Afterwards, an older man arrived, and didn’t like the table they suggested, and he sat at the other end of mine.  He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn’t touch his food except for bread. Several veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list. Several outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Zürich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table. Bathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe. I would return earlier to try some of the other menu items.\n","\n","****************************************\n","Restaurant \"LaSalle\" has a rating of 4.3 based on 593 single ratings and 5 reviews. \n","-----\n","Review#: 0 / Rating: 5 / Text: It was amazing!

The ravioli was totally the highlight as it was delicious.\n","Review#: 1 / Rating: 3 / Text: Quality of food: The quality of food is good and the portions are of a good size. But, there isn't a lot of variety to the menu.  Although the restaurant changes its menu each season, they reuse the same menu from the previous season. I believe it would be a great addition to your offer if you were to switch a few things here and there from time to time.  Concerning the service, they were overall friendly, but we felt that they could be a bit more professional and polite to their customers. The establishment was clean, though. :)\n","Review#: 2 / Rating: 3 / Text: I have been to this restaurant during a lunch break with colleagues.

The outside area was fine for an outdoor linch during summer time.\n","Review#: 3 / Rating: 4 / Text: Came here for dinner - it was pretty empty on a Thursday night.

From the moment we entered, the stunning decor captivated us – a harmonious blend of rich reds, intricate golds, and traditional art that set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.  The service? Simply impeccable! Waitstaff dressed in elegant traditional attire greeted us warmly and ensured that every detail was attended to with a professional touch. I particularly appreciated the thoughtful gesture of handling our plates with clean napkins – a small but significant nod to their commitment to hygiene and fine dining.  Now, onto the feast! We began our culinary journey with the Chicken Satay, which came with a peanut sauce so divine it could have been a meal on its own 🥜. My wife savored her Virgin Mojito, a refreshing concoction that perfectly complemented her Nüa Pad Prig Thai Orn (Thai chili beef) 🥩🌶️. The beef was tender, with just the right amount of spice to make her taste buds dance.  I opted for their signature Angkor Cocktail 🍹, a delightful mix that set the tone for my main course – the Nüa Pad Thai. The flavors were a symphony of sweet, sour, and savory, each bite leaving me craving more. What truly elevated the experience were the high risers used for serving – not only did they add a touch of elegance, but they also kept our dishes warm throughout the meal.  And let's talk about those plates! Each one was a work of art, meticulously designed and changing with every course. It was like dining in a palace, where every detail was crafted to perfection. The beautiful ceramic dishes were almost too pretty to eat from – almost!  In summary, Angkor Restaurant offers more than just a meal; it’s a luxurious dive into Thai culinary artistry, wrapped in an atmosphere of serene elegance. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply indulging in a night out, this gem in Zurich promises an exquisite experience that will leave you with a heart full of joy and a belly full of delight. 🍽️✨\n","Review#: 1 / Rating: 4 / Text: I came here for my birthday with friends and made a reservation a month in advance. I mainly wanted to come for karoake as it is listed on the website, but sadly it does not exist anymore (please update your website!).  The staff seemed pretty stressed out. I ordered two bottles of champagne for my table and the staff forgot to pour one glass for a guest.  I wanted to order the mixed dim sum for the table and asked how many people does it feed. I guess the staff thought I and others asked how many pieces because they answered “for four”. As we were ten people I ordered two orders. The staff came back with four plates only and the two baskets of four pieces of tiny dumplings. We had to order another two and an additional appetizer to feed everyone.  After we all ordered our food and received it, we did not receive enough plates. The staff seemed angry that we asked more than once for plates because he said I know, as he poured our drinks we ordered after we asked for plates.  We all ordered dessert and finished it. Afterward the staff came and brought me the same dessert I ordered, and sang happy birthday. I was a bit confused, but also questioning why did you not present me this dessert before me ordering it 😂  It seems a bit unorganized here as there were a lot of guests and perhaps because we were a table of 10. Food was good but I would not come back here again.\n","Review#: 2 / Rating: 5 / Text: I had the aquarium menu experience twice. The food is very tasty and the service is also good.

Negative side: the pool price is calculated not based on the actual play time, but on the time frame you are in possession of the balls, so if your table is far away and you need 1-2 min walk to reach it, or if you have to wait in line to give back the balls, you pay for such dead time, and with a price of 1 fr / 2 min this is not irrelevant.

Otherwise all the dishes we tried tasted great and had a nice richness to them, I particularly recommend the tuna bowl.  The restaurant had a very cozy and relaxing vibe to it, and we really enjoyed the open kitchen where we could watch the chef cooking at the woks.  All of the staff were extremely kind, and also very helpful when making the reservation.\n","Review#: 2 / Rating: 4 / Text: It is a fusion Asian restaurant, not traditional Asian. It has existed for over 20 years. And of course the food is very good and freshly prepared in an open kitchen. All you can eat sushi night is fun for sushi lovers. It offers good options for vegetarians and some vegan. Another fun fact is that there are only shared tables. There are lots of public parking spaces around, lots of bars and other restaurants. As in most spots is public transportation. Pricing is medium to high for swiss standards. It is beside a movie theatre, so ideal spot dinner and a movie.\n","Review#: 3 / Rating: 5 / Text: Had nice sushi and Nahida was our smiling waitress, we enjoying her Positives Vibes!\n","Review#: 4 / Rating: 5 / Text: Had a great lunch experience!

I didn’t manage to get a booking on a Friday evening so we tried our luck to walk in around 6pm. We were considered lucky to have dinner here as the place was filled around 8pm..!  Ambience- cozy and nice space with some traditional rustic vibes  Service- There are three waiters when we were there and all of them were not as attentive and being helpful with menus when we asked them question. Not sure if they don’t understand English at all or doesn’t want to…this affects our dining experience which was a bit disappointing.  Food- we’ve ordered the meat loaf and veal steak. Both were very homely made taste and flavourful which we enjoyed very much. I specially adore their spactzle! I would highly recommend to have it as sides. For starter we had the bone marrow beef soup and beef tartare- the soup was OK, don’t think there’s any wow factor in there but the beef tartare was amazing.  Overall this is the comfort food I had in Zurich and I really enjoyed the food. Hopefully service will improve next time that will makes it perfect :)\n","Review#: 3 / Rating: 5 / Text: Very authentic Swiss cuisine, with a refined twist.

My fried fish (pla la prik) was delicious, so tasty and crispy on the outside with the perfect spice level. The vegetables also compliment the fish very well.

The chunks of dragon fruit were a nice addition too. I will definitely be back to try more menu items. Definitely recommend this Asian restaurant if you’re in the area.\n","Review#: 4 / Rating: 4 / Text: The Green Thai Curry was too salty for my liking. Served in a big bowl but ingredient was a tad stingy given the price. Chicken Fried Rice was decent, portion was decent too. Iced tea was too blend, if the taste is much stronger than it was, I think it would be perfect.  Ambience, services and cleanliness are all not bad.

I felt the presence of potatoes were over powering the already delicate taste of octopus. Service is overall very good. Handsome, well dressed waiters with not very good listening but speaking skills.  He mentioned to be updating their pizza oven with higher temperatures soon. Atmosphere is ok.

We received our order within 5 minutes. I only got a diet sprite for myself, since they showed the calories of my initial food order on the display - which definitely felt like a slap in the face for someone recovering from an eating disorder. My partner said that his food was rather underwhelming compared to the stuff we know - crispy chicken nuggets not being crispy and overall didn't taste like much. Also, if you're on a trip and have your phone on flight mode to avoid roaming costs, don't bother trying to connect to the WiFi. You need to receive a confirmation message to be able to use it.

Despite these nice sides I was quite disappointed: I saw 2 days ago the trailer, in riffraff, for The zone of interest, which was in German (original), subtitled in french (my mother tongue). Today I went to see it (18:40), and asked at the cashier if there would be subtitles. She assured me that it would be German with German subtitles, which would have been ok for me to understand. But it was sadly in German without subtitles, letting me miss out on all the interesting parts of this specific film: the fact that you understand over the characters chitchat and low talk, how they consider the KL Auschwitz, next to which they live. I had to read the extensively detailed Wikipedia article about the film to fully get it. Had I known that it wouldn’t be subtitled, I would have spared myself the cost of the ticket !\n","Review#: 4 / Rating: 4 / Text: Small indie cinema in the heart of Zurich.

Admission only when vaccinated or recovered (2G-rule) with COVID Certificate (Swiss or EU compatible) and ID. I did register on their website and received covid-tracing SMS, but…no one asked for it, no one checked it, etc. Music seriously needs some changes. No ’coat check’. You can only (as I understood) pay in cash. DJ was smoking weed, so the smell in general wasn’t pleasant. Drinks are really affordable (compared to others in the area/city). Diverse crowd.

The food itself was a letdown, with some dishes overly salty, others served cold, and overall quality failing to meet our expectations.

The kitchen was closed on a Wednesday around 22:00 as many restaurants in the area, pizza cook still tossing dough, though.  They seem to become patio nightclubs more than restaurants. A glass was placed at my table, after reading other reviews, it seems water is either self service where the carafes are on the wall, or they want you to order bottled. Afterwards, an older man arrived, and didn’t like the table they suggested, and he sat at the other end of mine.  He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn’t touch his food except for bread. Several veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list. Several outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Zürich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table. Bathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe.

From the moment we entered, the stunning decor captivated us – a harmonious blend of rich reds, intricate golds, and traditional art that set the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.  The service? Simply impeccable! Waitstaff dressed in elegant traditional attire greeted us warmly and ensured that every detail was attended to with a professional touch. I particularly appreciated the thoughtful gesture of handling our plates with clean napkins – a small but significant nod to their commitment to hygiene and fine dining.  Now, onto the feast! We began our culinary journey with the Chicken Satay, which came with a peanut sauce so divine it could have been a meal on its own 🥜. My wife savored her Virgin Mojito, a refreshing concoction that perfectly complemented her Nüa Pad Prig Thai Orn (Thai chili beef) 🥩🌶️. The beef was tender, with just the right amount of spice to make her taste buds dance.  I opted for their signature Angkor Cocktail 🍹, a delightful mix that set the tone for my main course – the Nüa Pad Thai. The flavors were a symphony of sweet, sour, and savory, each bite leaving me craving more. What truly elevated the experience were the high risers used for serving – not only did they add a touch of elegance, but they also kept our dishes warm throughout the meal.  And let's talk about those plates! Each one was a work of art, meticulously designed and changing with every course. It was like dining in a palace, where every detail was crafted to perfection. The beautiful ceramic dishes were almost too pretty to eat from – almost!  In summary, Angkor Restaurant offers more than just a meal; it’s a luxurious dive into Thai culinary artistry, wrapped in an atmosphere of serene elegance. Whether you’re celebrating a special occasion or simply indulging in a night out, this gem in Zurich promises an exquisite experience that will leave you with a heart full of joy and a belly full of delight. 🍽️✨\n","Review#: 1 / Rating: 4 / Text: I came here for my birthday with friends and made a reservation a month in advance. I mainly wanted to come for karoake as it is listed on the website, but sadly it does not exist anymore (please update your website!).  The staff seemed pretty stressed out. I ordered two bottles of champagne for my table and the staff forgot to pour one glass for a guest.  I wanted to order the mixed dim sum for the table and asked how many people does it feed. I guess the staff thought I and others asked how many pieces because they answered “for four”. As we were ten people I ordered two orders. The staff came back with four plates only and the two baskets of four pieces of tiny dumplings. We had to order another two and an additional appetizer to feed everyone.  After we all ordered our food and received it, we did not receive enough plates. The staff seemed angry that we asked more than once for plates because he said I know, as he poured our drinks we ordered after we asked for plates.  We all ordered dessert and finished it. Afterward the staff came and brought me the same dessert I ordered, and sang happy birthday. I was a bit confused, but also questioning why did you not present me this dessert before me ordering it 😂  It seems a bit unorganized here as there were a lot of guests and perhaps because we were a table of 10.

Ambience- cozy and nice space with some traditional rustic vibes  Service- There are three waiters when we were there and all of them were not as attentive and being helpful with menus when we asked them question. Not sure if they don’t understand English at all or doesn’t want to…this affects our dining experience which was a bit disappointing.  Food- we’ve ordered the meat loaf and veal steak. Both were very homely made taste and flavourful which we enjoyed very much. I specially adore their spactzle! I would highly recommend to have it as sides. For starter we had the bone marrow beef soup and beef tartare- the soup was OK, don’t think there’s any wow factor in there but the beef tartare was amazing.  Overall this is the comfort food I had in Zurich and I really enjoyed the food. Hopefully service will improve next time that will makes it perfect :)\n","Review#: 3 / Rating: 5 / Text: Very authentic Swiss cuisine, with a refined twist.

Several veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list.

The washroom was also not cleaned upto the mark. When we requested for empty plates and cutlery to feed the kids our food during our stay, we were told that they are chargeable. Nowhere, in any country or hotel that we have stayed in have we ever been asked to pay for empty bowls and cutlery. Even warm milk for the kids is generally provided complementary by the hotel which was chargeable here.

The food itself was a letdown, with some dishes overly salty, others served cold, and overall quality failing to meet our expectations.

The kitchen was closed on a Wednesday around 22:00 as many restaurants in the area, pizza cook still tossing dough, though.  They seem to become patio nightclubs more than restaurants. A glass was placed at my table, after reading other reviews, it seems water is either self service where the carafes are on the wall, or they want you to order bottled. Afterwards, an older man arrived, and didn’t like the table they suggested, and he sat at the other end of mine.  He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn’t touch his food except for bread. Several veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list. Several outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Zürich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends.

The room cleaning was not good as sweeping and mopping of the rooms was probably done on only 1 day out of the 5 days that we stayed; only the beds were made. The washroom was also not cleaned upto the mark. When we requested for empty plates and cutlery to feed the kids our food during our stay, we were told that they are chargeable. Nowhere, in any country or hotel that we have stayed in have we ever been asked to pay for empty bowls and cutlery. Even warm milk for the kids is generally provided complementary by the hotel which was chargeable here. The play area could have been much better given the ample space.\n","****************************************\n","gas_ev_charging \"Hotel Casa Rodolfo / Casa Heinrich\" has a rating of 3.7 based on 7 single ratings and 5 reviews. \n","-----\n","Review#: 0 / Rating: 4 / Text: Good clean room for the price, especially in Switzerland where everything is expensive.

Despite the steep prices, the service fell short of expectations. From wine being forgotten to be served,  to plates arriving at different times for each diner (even though we each ordered our own tasting menu), it was simply unacceptable.  The food itself was a letdown, with some dishes overly salty, others served cold, and overall quality failing to meet our expectations.  While the views were the sole highlight, the cramped tables left little room for comfort. In fact, our neighboring diners felt closer than our own partner across the table.  Save yourself the disappointment and explore other dining options. Our experience here was regrettable.\n","Review#: 3 / Rating: 1 / Text: The food was good, nice atmosphere with beautiful view.

The kitchen was closed on a Wednesday around 22:00 as many restaurants in the area, pizza cook still tossing dough, though.  They seem to become patio nightclubs more than restaurants. A glass was placed at my table, after reading other reviews, it seems water is either self service where the carafes are on the wall, or they want you to order bottled. Afterwards, an older man arrived, and didn’t like the table they suggested, and he sat at the other end of mine.  He ordered something in German.  They brought him bread, subsequently a plate of something arrived (I guess it was cold requiring no preparation). While I ate my pizza he didn’t touch his food except for bread. Several veg pizza choices including one without cheese. Complete wine/beer/bar list. Several outdoor dining patios on various levels, the occasional train screeching by reminds you of the industrial origins of West Zürich. Inside I could imagine it very busy on weekends. Chill upbeat music, football table. Bathrooms are downstairs so not easily accessible. Funky graffiti and stickers give it a bit of an underground vibe.
